string is just array of characters in c
data type is always char
syntax char stringname [size];
it is a character array generally ending with null chharacter
string is not a datatype in charformat specifier for c is "%s"
size of string length of characters plus one , which is for storing null character;
scanf will not consider " " space as a string therefore compiler will automatically put null at the space and consider it sis the end of the string 
in gets() we dont need to use the format specifier
when we provide the index number in string and try to print the value it will print the whole string characters starting from the provided index number

if we want to use any predifined functions in string we have to use string.h
